libserialport: cross-platform library for accessing serial ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

libserialport is a minimal library written in C that is intended to take care
of the OS-specific details when writing software that uses serial ports.

By writing your serial code to use libserialport, you enable it to work
transparently on any platform supported by the library.

The operations that are supported are:

- Port enumeration (obtaining a list of serial ports on the system).
- Obtaining port metadata (USB device information, Bluetooth address, etc).
- Opening and closing ports.
- Setting port parameters (baud rate, parity, etc).
- Reading, writing and flushing data.
- Obtaining error information.

libserialport is an open source project released under the LGPL3+ license.

Status
======

The library should build and work on any Windows or Unix-based system. If it
does not, please submit a bug.

Enumeration is currently implemented on Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Linux.
On other systems enumeration is not supported, but ports can still be opened
by name and then used.

If you know how to enumerate available ports on another OS, please submit a bug
with this information, or better still a patch implementing it.

Dependencies
============

No other libraries are required.

Building
========

The package uses a GNU style build system and requires a Unix style shell.

Windows builds can be created natively with the MinGW-w64 toolchain and
MSYS2 environment, or cross-compiled using a MinGW-w64 toolchain:

  http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/

The "old" MinGW from http://mingw.org/ is not supported.

Run "./autogen.sh" to generate the build system, "./configure" to setup, then
"make" to build the library and "make install" to install it.

API
===

Doxygen API documentation is included.
