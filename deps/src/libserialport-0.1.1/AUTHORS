AUTHORS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Martin Ling conceived the idea for the library, designed the API and wrote much
of the implementation and documentation.

The initial codebase was adapted from serial code in libsigrok, written by Bert
Vermeulen and Uwe Hermann, who gave permission for it to be relicensed under
the LGPL3+ for inclusion in libserialport.

The package is maintained by Uwe Hermann, with input from Martin Ling.

Aurelien Jacobs made several contributions, including the USB metadata API,
improvements to the port enumeration code, and eliminating the previous
dependence on libudev for enumeration on Linux.

Uffe Jakobsen contributed the FreeBSD support.

Matthias Heidbrink contributed support for non-standard baudrates on Mac OS X.

Bug fixes have been contributed by Bert Vermeulen, silverbuddy, Marcus
Comstedt, Antti Nykanen, Michael B. Trausch and Janne Huttunen.

For a full history of contributions, see the git history.

Others have helped the project by contributing bug reports and discussion.
